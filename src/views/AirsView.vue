          <h1>AI Resource Search (AIRS)</h1>
          <p>AI Resource Search (AIRS) is an innovative Flask-based web API that serves as a gateway for exploring and
            engaging with AI-related content. Designed primarily for students, researchers, and academics, AIRS offers a
            comprehensive platform to access, analyze, and interact with AI-focused information.</p>

        <section class="project-evolution">
          <h2>Project Evolution and Roles</h2>
          <p>The initial version of AIRS was a collaborative project where I played a pivotal role in developing the
            React frontend, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience. The backend, managed by my peers, was
            robust, involving complex data processing techniques to gather and recommend AI-related content.</p>
          <p>Building on this foundational work, I embarked on developing a new version of the backend aimed at
            simplifying the existing complexities. This iteration was designed to improve performance and scalability by
            optimizing data handling and streamlining the recommendation processes, making the platform more efficient
            and user-friendly.</p>
